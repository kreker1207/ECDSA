# ECDSA
ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is a digital signature algorithm used to ensure the authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of digital messages. It is based on the use of elliptic curves in cryptography. ECDSA uses the mathematical properties of elliptic curves to create digital signatures. The algorithm includes generation of a key pair (private and public keys), signing a message with a private key, and verifying the signature using a public key.
ECDSA is a popular digital signature algorithm, especially in the context of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). It is used in many cryptographic protocols and systems such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, TLS/SSL and others.
## Task
Implement key pair generation, message hashing and signing, digital signature verification using your wrapper functions. For convenience of passing data between functions, as well as outputting data to the screen or writing to a file, implement serialization and deserialization functions for the following data: private key, public key, and digital signature.
